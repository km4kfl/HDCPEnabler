# HDCPEnabler

This program enables HDCP on Microsoft Windows. It enables HDCP only
on the display it starts up on. It does not enable HDCP on all displays
from my testing. To make it start on a specific display set that display
to be your primary display in Display settings on Windows. You can change
it back after this program starts.

From testing and research HDCP will not become disabled when this program
exists. The only way to turn off HDCP is to reset the display link such as unplugging the cable.

The program will tell you if HDCP has been requested and will report if
it is enabled. 

It may not work on some displays such as built-in laptop displays but it
may work with an external display if HDCP is supported by the graphics
card and the monitor device.

This program uses the certified output protection protocol (COPP).
